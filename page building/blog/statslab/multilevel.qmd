## Understanding Multilevel Models

Multilevel modeling (also known as hierarchical linear modeling or mixed-effects modeling) extends the panel data framework to handle nested data structures that are ubiquitous in health research. While panel data considers observations across entities and time, multilevel models address situations where individual observations are nested within higher-level units, creating natural hierarchies in the data structure.

In public health research, we frequently encounter multilevel structures such as:

- **Counties nested within states** (our focus)
- Patients nested within hospitals
- Students nested within schools nested within districts
- Individuals nested within neighborhoods nested within cities

This hierarchical structure violates the independence assumption of traditional regression models because observations within the same higher-level unit tend to be more similar to each other than to observations in other units - a phenomenon known as **intracluster correlation**.

### 1. The Hierarchical Structure of Health Data

Consider mortality data where counties are nested within states. This creates a natural two-level hierarchy:

- **Level 1 (County level)**: Individual counties with their characteristics
- **Level 2 (State level)**: States that contain multiple counties

The key insight is that counties within the same state share certain unmeasured characteristics (state policies, climate, regional culture) that make them more similar to each other than to counties in other states. Ignoring this structure can lead to:

1. **Underestimated standard errors** (false precision)
2. **Biased estimates** when state-level factors correlate with predictors
3. **Missed opportunities** to understand policy effects at different levels

Let's start by loading the necessary packages and creating a multilevel health dataset:

```{r library-setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required packages for multilevel modeling
library(lme4)      # For multilevel models
library(lmerTest)  # For p-values in lme4
library(sjPlot)    # For model visualization
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(patchwork)
library(performance) # For ICC calculations
library(broom.mixed) # For tidy model outputs
library(merTools)   # For prediction intervals
library(texreg)     # For model comparison tables
```

```{r simulate-multilevel-data}
# Create realistic multilevel health data: counties nested within states
set.seed(123)

# Define state-level characteristics (Level 2)
n_states <- 8
state_info <- data.frame(
  state_id = 1:n_states,
  state_name = c("California", "Texas", "Florida", "New York", "Pennsylvania",

Our multilevel dataset contains `r nrow(county_data)` counties nested within `r n_states` states. The data structure includes:

**Level 2 (State-level) Variables:**

- Medicaid expansion status (policy variable)
- State health spending per capita
- Tobacco tax rates
- Air quality index
- Unobserved state characteristics (random effects)

**Level 1 (County-level) Variables:**

- Rural/urban status
- Median household income
- Healthcare infrastructure (hospitals, physicians)
- Health behaviors (smoking, obesity, physical inactivity)
- Unobserved county characteristics (random effects)

### 2. Understanding Intracluster Correlation in Health Data

When we have nested data like counties within states, observations within the same group tend to be more similar to each other than to observations in different groups. This similarity is called **intracluster correlation**, and it's why we need multilevel models.

Think about it: counties in the same state share many characteristics - they have the same state policies, similar climate, regional culture, and economic conditions. This makes counties within Texas more similar to each other than to counties in New York.

#### 2.1. Why Standard Regression Fails

Standard regression assumes all observations are independent. But in our nested data:

- Counties within the same state are NOT independent
- They share unmeasured state-level factors
- Standard errors will be too small (overconfident results)
- We might miss important policy effects

Let's see this clustering in our data:
  
```{r state-clustering-visualization, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# First, let's see the basic pattern
state_means <- county_data %>%
  group_by(state_name, medicaid_expansion) %>%
  summarize(
    n_counties = n(),
    mean_mortality = mean(mortality_rate),
    sd_mortality = sd(mortality_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(mean_mortality)

# Show state means
state_means %>%
  mutate(medicaid_status = ifelse(medicaid_expansion == 1, "Expanded", "Not Expanded")) %>%
  dplyr::select(state_name, n_counties, mean_mortality, sd_mortality, medicaid_status) %>%
  kable(digits = 1, caption = "Average Mortality Rate by State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  row_spec(which(state_means$medicaid_expansion == 1), background = "#E8F5E8")

# Visualize the clustering
ggplot(county_data, aes(x = reorder(state_name, mortality_rate), 
                        y = mortality_rate)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = factor(medicaid_expansion)), 
              width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", 
               size = 4, shape = 23, fill = "red", color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("0" = "coral", "1" = "steelblue"),
                     labels = c("No Medicaid Expansion", "Medicaid Expanded"),
                     name = "Policy Status") +
  labs(title = "County Mortality Rates Show Clear State Clustering",
       subtitle = "Red diamonds = state averages. Notice how counties cluster by state!",
       x = "State (ordered by mortality rate)", 
       y = "Mortality Rate per 100,000") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

#### 2.2. Measuring Clustering: The ICC

The **Intracluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** tells us how much clustering exists. It answers: "How much of the total variance is between states vs. within states?"

**Formula:** 
$ICC = \frac{\sigma^2_{between}}{\sigma^2_{between} + \sigma^2_{within}}$
  
  Where:

- $\sigma^2_{between}$ = how much states differ from each other
- $\sigma^2_{within}$ = how much counties vary within each state

#### 2.3. Calculating ICC

The easiest way is to fit an "empty" multilevel model with no predictors:
  
```{r calculate-icc}
# Step 1: Fit empty model (intercept + random state effects only)
empty_model <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ 1 + (1|state_id), data = county_data)

# Step 2: Look at the variance components
print(VarCorr(empty_model), comp = "Variance")

# Step 3: Calculate ICC manually
variance_components <- as.data.frame(VarCorr(empty_model))
between_state_var <- variance_components$vcov[1]  # State variance
within_state_var <- variance_components$vcov[2]   # Residual variance
total_variance <- between_state_var + within_state_var

icc <- between_state_var / total_variance

# Option 1: Clean table format
variance_table <- data.frame(
  Component = c("Between-state variance", "Within-state variance", "Total variance"),
  Value = c(between_state_var, within_state_var, total_variance),
  Percentage = c(100*icc, 100*(1-icc), 100)
)

kable(variance_table, 
      digits = 1,
      col.names = c("Variance Component", "Value", "Percentage (%)"),
      caption = "Variance Decomposition Results") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  row_spec(3, bold = TRUE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Variance" = 2))

cat(sprintf("\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = %.3f (%.1f%%)", icc, 100*icc))
```

#### 2.4. Interpreting ICC Values

**ICC Interpretation Guide:**
  
- **ICC < 0.05**: Minimal clustering (multilevel modeling optional)
- **ICC 0.05-0.10**: Small clustering (multilevel modeling recommended)  
- **ICC 0.10-0.25**: Moderate clustering (multilevel modeling important)
- **ICC > 0.25**: Large clustering (multilevel modeling essential)

**What Our ICC Means:**
  
Our calculated ICC reveals striking insights about the structure of our health data. With an ICC of 0.798, this means:
  
- 79.8% of mortality variance occurs BETWEEN states
- 20.2% of mortality variance occurs WITHIN states  
- Counties in the same state are 79.8% more similar to each other than to random counties from other states

**Decision for Our Analysis:**
  
Since our ICC > 0.25 (and dramatically so), multilevel modeling is absolutely essential. This extremely high clustering indicates that ignoring the nested structure would lead to:
  
- Severely underestimated standard errors (false precision)
- Highly misleading conclusions about predictor significance
- Complete failure to capture the dominant state-level effects on health outcomes

**What This Tells Us About Health:**
  
  This ICC level reveals that state-level factors overwhelmingly dominate county health outcomes. Nearly four-fifths of the variation in mortality rates is attributable to systematic differences between states rather than local county characteristics. This suggests that state policies, healthcare systems, environmental regulations, and regional culture create extremely powerful contextual effects that strongly determine health outcomes for all counties within a state's borders.

The relatively small within-state variation (20.2%) indicates that while county-level factors still matter, state context is by far the primary driver of health disparities. This multilevel structure demonstrates that effective health interventions must prioritize state-level policy changes, as local county-level interventions alone may have limited impact within the broader state policy environment.

#### 2.5. What This Means for Our Analysis

The ICC reveals important insights about our health data:
  
1. **Substantial clustering exists**: Counties within states are much more similar than counties across states
2. **State-level factors matter**: A significant portion of health outcomes is determined by state-level characteristics
3. **Policy implications**: State policies (like Medicaid expansion) create systematic differences across all counties in a state
4. **Methodological necessity**: We need multilevel models to properly account for this clustering

In the next section, we'll build multilevel models that properly handle this nested structure and give us correct standard errors and meaningful policy insights.

### 3. The Multilevel Model Framework

Multilevel models (also called hierarchical linear models or mixed-effects models) are designed for **nested data structures**, where lower-level units (e.g., counties) are grouped within higher-level units (e.g., states). Standard regression assumes all observations are independent, but multilevel models account for **within-group correlation** and allow **group-level variation** in both intercepts and slopes.

**Key concepts:**

- **Levels:**
 - **Level 1 (County, $i$):** Individual observations at the lower level (counties within states). The **level 1 equation** models county-level mortality as:
   $$Mortality_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_1 Income_{ij} + \beta_2 Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \beta_4 Unemployment_{ij} + \cdots + r_{ij}$$
 - **Level 2 (State, $j$):** Higher-level grouping units (states). The **level 2 equations** model how parameters vary across states:
   $$\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} MedicaidExp_j + \gamma_{02} HealthSpend_j + u_{0j}$$
   $$\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + u_{1j} \quad \text{(if income effect varies by state)}$$

- **Fixed effects** ($\gamma$ parameters): Average associations across all states, representing population-level relationships such as the mean effect of county income, smoking, or obesity on mortality.

- **Random effects** ($u$ terms): State-specific deviations from the fixed effects, capturing heterogeneity across states:

 - $u_{0j} \sim N(0, \tau_{00})$: Random intercept capturing baseline mortality differences between states
 - $u_{1j} \sim N(0, \tau_{11})$: Random slope capturing how predictor effects vary between states

- **Residuals** ($r_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$): County-level deviations capturing **within-state variation** not explained by predictors.

- **Cross-level interactions:** Terms where state-level factors modify county-level relationships:
 $$\text{Effect of Income} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11} \times MedicaidExp_j$$
 This captures whether Medicaid expansion strengthens or weakens the income-mortality association.

- **Intraclass Correlation (ICC):** Proportion of total variance attributable to state-level clustering:
 $$ICC = \frac{\tau_{00}}{\tau_{00} + \sigma^2}$$
 Higher ICC values indicate greater similarity within states relative to between-state differences.

**Why use multilevel models?**

1. **Corrects standard errors** for clustered data, providing appropriate uncertainty estimates
2. **Partitions variation** into within-group and between-group components
3. **Models contextual effects** by incorporating group-level predictors and cross-level interactions
4. **Improves predictions** through partial pooling, borrowing strength across similar groups
5. **Addresses ecological fallacy** by properly modeling relationships at multiple levels

This framework enables us to examine how county characteristics relate to mortality while accounting for state-level clustering and investigating how state policies modify these relationships.

### 4. Model Types and Complexity

#### 4.1 Random Intercept Model (Simplest)

The random intercept model allows only the **intercept** to vary by state, assuming that the effects of county-level predictors (income, smoking, obesity, etc.) are the same across all states.

**Level 1 (County) Model:**
$$Mortality_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_1 Income_{ij} + \beta_2 Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \beta_4 Unemployment_{ij} + \cdots + r_{ij}$$

**Level 2 (State) Model:**
$$\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j}$$
$$\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots \text{ are fixed across states}$$

**Combined (Mixed) Form:**
$$Mortality_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \beta_1 Income_{ij} + \beta_2 Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \beta_4 Unemployment_{ij} + \cdots + u_{0j} + r_{ij}$$

**Variance Components:**

- $u_{0j} \sim N(0, \tau_{00})$: Random intercept for state $j$, capturing deviations from the overall mean baseline mortality
- $r_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$: Residual for county $i$ in state $j$, capturing **within-state variation**
- **Intraclass Correlation (ICC):**
$$ICC = \frac{\tau_{00}}{\tau_{00} + \sigma^2}$$

This ICC represents the proportion of total variance in mortality that occurs **between states** rather than within states, indicating the degree of clustering at the state level.

```{r random-intercept-model}
# Random intercept model
model_ri <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ median_income + smoking_rate + obesity_rate + 
                 unemployment_rate + hospitals_per_100k + 
                 primary_care_physicians_per_100k + 
                 factor(rural_status) + 
                 (1 | state_id), 
                data = county_data, REML = TRUE)

# Display results
tab_model(model_ri)
# Calculate and display ICC
icc_model <- performance::icc(model_ri)
```

The random intercept model shows:

- **Fixed effects**: The average associations between predictors and mortality, pooled across all states. These correspond to the $\beta$ or $\gamma$ parameters in the model equations.
- **Random intercept variance**: $\tau_{00} = 13387.26$ — the variation in baseline mortality **between states** captured by $u_{0j}$.
- **Residual variance**: $\sigma^2 = 821.22$ — the remaining variation **within states** (between counties), represented by $r_{ij}$.
- **Intraclass Correlation (ICC)**: 0.94 — the proportion of total variance in mortality attributable to differences **between states** after accounting for predictors.

This high ICC value indicates that even after accounting for county-level characteristics, 94% of the remaining mortality variation occurs **between states** rather than within states. This highlights the critical importance of state-level factors (policies, healthcare systems, environmental conditions) in shaping health outcomes, suggesting that county-level interventions alone may have limited impact without addressing broader state-level determinants.

**Figure Interpretation:** The random intercept model reveals important baseline differences across states while assuming uniform effects of county-level predictors. The parallel lines demonstrate several key patterns:

1. **Intercept variation**: States have substantially different baseline mortality levels, with some states consistently higher or lower than others across all income levels. The vertical separation between lines represents these state-specific deviations from the national average.

2. **Parallel slopes**: All lines have the same slope, indicating that the protective effect of income on mortality is assumed to be identical across all states. This constraint means that a $10,000 increase in median household income has the same predicted reduction in mortality rate regardless of the state context.

3. **State rankings consistency**: States maintain their relative ranking across the income distribution. For example, if State A has higher baseline mortality than State B, this relationship persists at all income levels.

The table of random intercepts quantifies these state-specific baseline deviations. Positive values indicate states with higher-than-average mortality rates after accounting for county-level characteristics, while negative values show states with lower-than-average mortality. These persistent state differences suggest the presence of unmeasured state-level factors (policies, healthcare systems, environmental conditions) that create systematic advantages or disadvantages for all counties within a state's borders.

This pattern supports the need for state-level interventions to address the fundamental contextual factors driving these baseline differences, as county-level interventions alone cannot overcome the broader state policy environment.

#### 4.2 Random Slope Model (More Complex)

The random slope model allows the effect of median income to vary across states, recognizing that income may have different protective effects depending on state context:

**Level 1 (County) Model:**
$$Mortality_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} Income_{ij} + \beta_2 Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \beta_4 Unemployment_{ij} + \cdots + r_{ij}$$

**Level 2 (State) Model:**
$$\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j}$$
$$\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + u_{1j}$$
$$\beta_2, \beta_3, \dots \text{ remain fixed across states}$$

**Combined (Mixed) Form:**
$$Mortality_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} Income_{ij} + \beta_2 Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \cdots + u_{0j} + u_{1j} Income_{ij} + r_{ij}$$

Where:

- $u_{0j}$: Random intercept for state $j$ (baseline mortality differences between states)
- $u_{1j}$: Random slope for median income in state $j$ (how the income-mortality relationship varies by state)

This extension allows us to test whether the protective effect of higher income is consistent across all states or varies systematically based on state-level characteristics.

```{r random-slope-model}
#| warning: false
# Random slope model - allowing income effect to vary by state
model_rs <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ median_income + smoking_rate + obesity_rate + 
                 unemployment_rate + hospitals_per_100k + 
                 primary_care_physicians_per_100k + 
                 factor(rural_status) + 
                 (1 + median_income | state_id), 
                data = county_data, REML = TRUE)

# Display results
tab_model(model_rs)

# Extract random effects
random_effects <- ranef(model_rs)$state_id
random_effects$state_name <- state_info$state_name[match(rownames(random_effects), state_info$state_id)]
```

The random slope model shows:

- **Fixed effects**: The average relationships between predictors and mortality across all states.
- **Random intercept variance**: $\tau_{00} = 4529.16$ — variation in baseline mortality **between states**.
- **Random slope variance (median income)**: $\tau_{11} = 0.98$ — variation in the effect of median income **across states**.
- **Intercept–slope correlation**: $\rho_{01} = 0.64$ — positive correlation indicating that states with higher baseline mortality tend to have stronger (more negative) income effects.
- **Residual variance**: $\sigma^2 = 651.47$ — the remaining within-state variation (between counties).

The model shows improved fit over the random intercept model (Conditional R² increased from 0.951 to 0.962) and reveals that the protective effect of income varies meaningfully across states. The positive correlation suggests that in states where mortality is generally higher, income differences may be even more consequential for health outcomes.

**Figure Interpretation:** The random slope model reveals important heterogeneity across states. Each colored line represents a different state's income-mortality relationship. We can see that:

1. **Slope variation**: Some states (e.g., those with steeper negative slopes) show stronger protective effects of income on mortality, while others show weaker relationships.
2. **Intercept variation**: States start at different baseline mortality levels (where lines would intersect the y-axis).
3. **Policy implications**: This heterogeneity suggests that income-support policies might have different effectiveness across states, and one-size-fits-all federal policies may not be optimal.

The table of random effects quantifies these state-specific deviations from the average relationship, helping identify which states might benefit most from targeted interventions.

#### 4.3 Cross-Level Interaction Model (Most Complex)

The cross-level interaction model incorporates state-level predictors and examines how state policies modify the effects of county-level variables:

**Level 1 (County) Model:**
$$Mortality_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} Income_{ij} + \beta_{2j} Smoking_{ij} + \beta_3 Obesity_{ij} + \beta_4 Unemployment_{ij} + \cdots + r_{ij}$$

**Level 2 (State) Model:**
$$\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} MedicaidExp_j + \gamma_{02} HealthSpend_j + \gamma_{03} TobaccoTax_j + u_{0j}$$
$$\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11} MedicaidExp_j$$
$$\beta_{2j} = \gamma_{20} + \gamma_{21} TobaccoTax_j$$
$$\beta_3, \beta_4, \dots \text{ remain fixed across states}$$

**Combined (Mixed) Form:**
$$\begin{align}
Mortality_{ij} = &\gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} Income_{ij} + \gamma_{20} Smoking_{ij} + \gamma_{01} MedicaidExp_j + \gamma_{02} HealthSpend_j + \gamma_{03} TobaccoTax_j \\
&+ \gamma_{11} (Income_{ij} \times MedicaidExp_j) + \gamma_{21} (Smoking_{ij} \times TobaccoTax_j) + \cdots + u_{0j} + r_{ij}
\end{align}$$

This model captures:

- **Main effects** of both county-level and state-level predictors
- **Cross-level interactions** showing how state policies modify county-level relationships
- $u_{0j}$: Random intercept capturing remaining baseline variation across states after accounting for state-level predictors

```{r cross-level-model}
# Cross-level interaction model
model_cli <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ 
                  # County-level main effects
                  median_income + smoking_rate + obesity_rate + 
                  unemployment_rate + hospitals_per_100k + 
                  primary_care_physicians_per_100k + 
                  factor(rural_status) +
                  
                  # State-level main effects
                  medicaid_expansion + state_health_spending + tobacco_tax +
                  
                  # Cross-level interactions
                  median_income:medicaid_expansion + 
                  smoking_rate:tobacco_tax +
                  
                  # Random effects
                  (1 | state_id), 
                 data = county_data, REML = TRUE)

tab_model(model_cli)
```

The cross-level interaction model shows:

- **Fixed effects**:

 - Average county-level associations between predictors (e.g., income, smoking, obesity) and mortality.
 - State-level effects (e.g., Medicaid expansion, state health spending, tobacco tax) on mortality.
 - **Cross-level interactions**: how state policies modify county-level relationships (e.g., whether income has a stronger protective effect in Medicaid expansion states, or smoking is more harmful in states with low tobacco taxes).
- **Random intercept variance**: $\tau_{00} = 287.93$ — variation in baseline mortality **between states** after including state-level predictors.
- **Residual variance**: $\sigma^2 = 603.88$ — remaining variation **within states** (between counties).
- **Intraclass Correlation (ICC)**: 0.32 — the proportion of total variance in mortality that lies **between states** after accounting for both county- and state-level predictors.

The dramatic improvement in explanatory power (Marginal R² = 0.934) and the substantial reduction in ICC (from 0.94 to 0.32) demonstrates that state-level predictors and cross-level interactions explain most of the between-state variation in mortality. This suggests that state policies and their interactions with local characteristics are key drivers of health disparities across the United States.

**Figure Interpretation:** The cross-level interaction results reveal important policy insights:

**Top Panel (Income × Medicaid Expansion):** The diverging lines show that the protective effect of income on mortality differs by Medicaid expansion status. In states without Medicaid expansion (red line), the income gradient is steeper—meaning low-income counties have particularly high mortality. In expansion states (blue line), this gradient is flatter, suggesting that Medicaid expansion partially compensates for income-based health disparities. This finding supports the hypothesis that Medicaid expansion provides a safety net that reduces health inequalities.

**Bottom Panel (Smoking × Tobacco Tax):** Higher tobacco taxes (orange line) reduce the harmful effect of smoking on mortality compared to low-tax states (blue line). The flatter slope in high-tax states suggests that tobacco taxation not only reduces smoking rates but also mitigates the health consequences of smoking, possibly through reduced intensity of smoking or funding for cessation programs. This demonstrates how state policies can modify behavioral risk factors' impacts on population health.

### 5. Model Comparison, Diagnostics, and Best Practices

#### 5.1 Model Comparison

```{r model-comparison}
# Compare models using information criteria
model_comparison <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Random Intercept", "Random Slope", "Cross-Level Interaction"),
  AIC = c(AIC(model_ri), AIC(model_rs), AIC(model_cli)),
  BIC = c(BIC(model_ri), BIC(model_rs), BIC(model_cli)),
  `Log Likelihood` = c(logLik(model_ri), logLik(model_rs), logLik(model_cli)),
  `Parameters` = c(attr(logLik(model_ri), "df"), 
                   attr(logLik(model_rs), "df"), 
                   attr(logLik(model_cli), "df"))
)

model_comparison %>%
  mutate(
    AIC = round(AIC, 1),
    BIC = round(BIC, 1),
    Log.Likelihood = round(Log.Likelihood, 1)
  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "Model Comparison for Health Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)

# Likelihood ratio tests
anova(model_ri, model_rs, model_cli)
```

The model comparison shows that increasing complexity (from random intercept to random slope to cross-level interactions) improves model fit as indicated by lower AIC values. The likelihood ratio tests confirm that each additional complexity is statistically justified.

#### 5.2 Model Diagnostics

```{r diagnostics, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
# 1. Residual diagnostics
county_data$residuals <- residuals(model_cli)
county_data$fitted <- fitted(model_cli)

# 2. Random effects diagnostics

# Create diagnostic plots
p_residuals <- ggplot(county_data, aes(x = fitted, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Fitted Values",
       subtitle = "Check for homoscedasticity and linearity",
       x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

p_qq <- ggplot(county_data, aes(sample = residuals)) +

  stat_qq_line(color = "red") +

       subtitle = "Check normality assumption",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles", y = "Sample Quantiles") +
  theme_minimal()

p_random <- data.frame(random_intercepts = random_intercepts) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = random_intercepts)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Q-Q Plot of Random Intercepts",
       subtitle = "Check normality of random effects",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles", y = "Random Intercepts") +
  theme_minimal()

p_leverage <- ggplot(county_data, aes(x = fitted, y = sqrt(abs(residuals)))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scale-Location Plot",
       subtitle = "Check homoscedasticity",
       x = "Fitted Values", y = "√|Residuals|") +
  theme_minimal()

p_residuals
p_qq
p_random
p_leverage
```

**Figure Interpretation:** The diagnostic plots assess key model assumptions:

1. **Residuals vs Fitted (top left)**: The blue loess line should be relatively flat around zero. Minor deviations suggest the model captures the main patterns well, though some non-linearity may remain.

2. **Q-Q Plot of Residuals (top right)**: Points following the red line indicate normally distributed residuals. Deviations at the tails are common in health data but shouldn't invalidate main conclusions.

3. **Q-Q Plot of Random Intercepts (bottom left)**: Checks if state-level random effects are normally distributed. With only 8 states, perfect normality is unlikely, but major deviations would be concerning.

4. **Scale-Location Plot (bottom right)**: A horizontal trend would indicate constant variance. Some heteroscedasticity is visible but not severe enough to require transformation.

#### 5.3 Variance Decomposition Analysis

```{r variance-decomposition, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Extract variance components from different models
var_components <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Null Model", "Random Intercept", "Random Slope", "Cross-Level"),
  State_Variance = c(
    VarCorr(lmer(mortality_rate ~ 1 + (1|state_id), county_data))$state_id[1,1],
    VarCorr(model_ri)$state_id[1,1],
    VarCorr(model_rs)$state_id[1,1],
    VarCorr(model_cli)$state_id[1,1]
  ),
  County_Variance = c(
    attr(VarCorr(lmer(mortality_rate ~ 1 + (1|state_id), county_data)), "sc")^2,
    attr(VarCorr(model_ri), "sc")^2,
    attr(VarCorr(model_rs), "sc")^2,
    attr(VarCorr(model_cli), "sc")^2
  )
)

var_components <- var_components %>%
  mutate(
    Total_Variance = State_Variance + County_Variance,
    Prop_State = State_Variance / Total_Variance,
    Prop_County = County_Variance / Total_Variance
  )

# Create visualization
library(tidyr)
var_long <- var_components %>%
  dplyr::select(Model, Prop_State, Prop_County) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Prop_State, Prop_County), 
               names_to = "Level", 
               values_to = "Proportion") %>%
  mutate(
    Level = gsub("Prop_", "", Level),
    Model = factor(Model, levels = c("Null Model", "Random Intercept", 
                                    "Random Slope", "Cross-Level"))
  )

ggplot(var_long, aes(x = Model, y = Proportion, fill = Level)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("State" = "#E74C3C", "County" = "#3498DB")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Variance Decomposition Across Model Types",
       subtitle = "How much variation is explained at each level",
       x = "Model Type",
       y = "Proportion of Variance",
       fill = "Level") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

**Figure Interpretation:** This variance decomposition shows how adding predictors and complexity changes the distribution of unexplained variance. In the null model, state-level factors account for a substantial portion of total variance. As we add county-level predictors (Random Intercept model), the proportion of county-level variance decreases because we're explaining it with our variables. The Random Slope and Cross-Level models further refine how variance is partitioned, with cross-level interactions explaining some of the between-state differences through policy variables.

### 6. Centering in Multilevel Models: A Critical Decision

One of the most important but often overlooked decisions in multilevel modeling is how to center continuous predictors. The choice of centering strategy fundamentally affects the interpretation of coefficients and can lead to dramatically different conclusions about the same data.

### 6.1 The Centering Problem

When we introduce a continuous predictor in a multilevel model, we have to decide how to **center** it. This choice changes the meaning of the intercept and sometimes the slope. Here are the three main approaches, using median county income as an example:

1. **Uncentered (raw values)**

   * We just use the variable as it is (e.g., raw median income).
   * **Interpretation**: The intercept represents the predicted outcome when income equals zero, which may be unrealistic (few counties have \$0 income).
   * **Use case**: Sometimes helpful if the zero point is substantively meaningful (e.g., number of children = 0).

2. **Grand mean centering**

   * Subtract the **overall mean** (across all counties) from each county’s value.
   * **Interpretation**: The intercept now represents the predicted outcome for a county with **average income**. Slopes represent the effect of income relative to the national average.
   * **Use case**: This is often the most interpretable default, because it avoids weird “zero” values and makes coefficients easier to explain across the whole sample.

3. **Group mean centering (a.k.a. within-group centering)**

   * Subtract the **state mean** from each county’s value.
   * **Interpretation**: The intercept now represents the predicted outcome for a county at the **average income level of its own state**. The slope shows how counties differ from each other *within the same state*, independent of between-state differences.
   * **Use case**: This is crucial when we want to isolate **within-state effects** and avoid conflating them with between-state variation.

    # Original income (uncentered)

    # Group mean centering (within state)

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

#### 6.2 The Contextual Effects Model

The contextual effects model explicitly separates within-group and between-group effects, providing the most complete understanding of how predictors operate at different levels.

```{r contextual-effects-setup}
# Create between and within components for contextual effects
county_data <- county_data %>%
  group_by(state_id) %>%
  mutate(
    # Between component: state mean (contextual effect)
    income_between = mean(median_income),
    # Within component: deviation from state mean  
    income_within = median_income - mean(median_income),
    
    # Also create these for other key variables

**Figure Interpretation:** This three-panel visualization highlights why it is essential to distinguish within- and between-state effects.

* **Panel A** illustrates how the overall association (black dotted line) blends two sources of variation: differences **within states** (colored regression lines) and differences **between states** (vertical dashed lines marking state means). Each state not only has its own income–mortality slope, but states also vary in their average levels of income and mortality.

* **Panel B** depicts the **between-state effect**: states with higher average income tend to experience lower average mortality. The contrast between red (no Medicaid expansion) and blue (expansion) states suggests that policy context shapes outcomes even at similar income levels. This is the ecological, or contextual, relationship operating at the state level.

* **Panel C** isolates the **within-state effect** by centering counties on their state means. This shows how counties diverge from their state’s average income and mortality. The negative slope reveals that, within a given state, wealthier counties consistently experience lower mortality—a relationship that holds once state-level differences are removed.

#### 6.3 Estimating and Interpreting Contextual Effects Models

```{r contextual-models}
# Model 1: Traditional random intercept model (for comparison)
model_traditional <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ median_income + smoking_rate + obesity_rate + 
                         (1 | state_id), data = county_data, REML = TRUE)

# Model 2: Full contextual effects model
model_contextual <- lmer(mortality_rate ~ 
                        # Within-state effects
                        income_within + smoking_within + obesity_within +
                        
                        # Between-state effects (contextual)
                        income_between + smoking_between + obesity_between +
                        
                        # Random intercept
                        (1 | state_id), 
                        data = county_data, REML = TRUE)

tab_model(model_traditional, model_contextual)

# Extract coefficients for testing
within_effect <- fixef(model_contextual)["income_within"]
between_effect <- fixef(model_contextual)["income_between"]
contextual_effect <- between_effect - within_effect

# Create results table
contextual_test <- data.frame(
  Component = c("Within-State Effect", "Between-State Effect", 
                "Contextual Effect (Difference)"),
  Value = c(
    round(within_effect, 3),
    round(between_effect, 3),
    round(contextual_effect, 3)
  ),
  Interpretation = c(
    "Effect of income changes within a state",
    "Effect of being in a higher-income state",
    "Additional effect of state context beyond individual income"
  )
)

contextual_test %>%
  kable(caption = "Testing for Contextual Effects: Is State Context Important?") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#FFF3CD")
```

The contextual effects analysis reveals whether the state-level context matters beyond individual county characteristics. A significant contextual effect (difference between within and between effects) indicates that being in a wealthier state confers health benefits beyond what would be expected from county income alone—possibly due to better state infrastructure, policies, or spillover effects.

### 7. Practical Applications and Policy Implications

#### 7.1 Policy Evaluation Framework

```{r policy-evaluation}
# Simulate policy intervention: What if all states expanded Medicaid?
county_data_counterfactual <- county_data %>%
  mutate(medicaid_expansion_counterfactual = 1)

# Predict mortality under universal Medicaid expansion
pred_universal <- predict(model_cli, newdata = county_data_counterfactual, re.form = NULL)
pred_current <- predict(model_cli, newdata = county_data, re.form = NULL)

# Calculate policy impact
policy_impact <- county_data %>%
  mutate(
    current_predicted = pred_current,
    universal_predicted = pred_universal,
    mortality_reduction = current_predicted - universal_predicted,
    lives_saved = (mortality_reduction / 100000) * population
  )

# Summarize impact by state
state_impact <- policy_impact %>%
  filter(medicaid_expansion == 0) %>%  # Only non-expansion states would be affected
  group_by(state_name) %>%
  summarize(
    counties_affected = n(),
    total_population = sum(population),
    avg_mortality_reduction = mean(mortality_reduction),
    total_lives_saved = sum(lives_saved),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_lives_saved))

state_impact %>%
  mutate(
    total_population = round(total_population / 1000000, 2),
    avg_mortality_reduction = round(avg_mortality_reduction, 1),
    total_lives_saved = round(total_lives_saved, 0)
  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "Projected Impact of Universal Medicaid Expansion",
        col.names = c("State", "Counties Affected", "Population (Millions)", 
                      "Avg Mortality Reduction", "Lives Saved Annually")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

This policy simulation demonstrates the real-world application of multilevel models. By estimating the effect of Medicaid expansion while accounting for the nested structure of the data, we can project potential lives saved if non-expansion states adopted the policy. The results show substantial potential benefits, with hundreds of lives potentially saved annually in large non-expansion states.

#### 7.2 Identifying High-Risk Areas for Targeted Interventions

```{r risk-identification, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Identify high-risk counties using model predictions and residuals
county_risk <- county_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_mortality = fitted(model_cli),
    state_effect = rep(ranef(model_cli)$state_id[,1], times = counties_per_state),
    county_residual = residuals(model_cli),
    risk_score = predicted_mortality + abs(county_residual)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(risk_score)) %>%
  mutate(risk_rank = row_number())

# Create risk visualization
p_risk_map <- ggplot(county_risk, aes(x = median_income, y = smoking_rate, 
                                     color = risk_score, size = population)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "yellow", high = "red", 
                        midpoint = mean(county_risk$risk_score),
                        name = "Risk Score") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population", range = c(1, 8), 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "County Risk Profile: Identifying Priority Areas for Intervention",
       subtitle = "Higher risk scores indicate counties with high mortality and high variability",
       x = "Median Household Income ($1000s)",
       y = "Smoking Rate (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

p_risk_map
```

**Figure Interpretation:** This risk map combines multiple dimensions to identify priority counties for public health interventions. The color gradient (blue to red) indicates overall mortality risk, with red counties having the highest predicted mortality plus unexplained variation. The size of points represents population, helping identify where interventions could have the greatest impact. Counties in the upper-left quadrant (low income, high smoking, shown in warmer colors) represent prime targets for intervention, especially those with large populations. This visualization helps policymakers allocate limited resources to areas with both high need and high potential impact.

### 9. Conclusion and Best Practices

Multilevel modeling provides a powerful framework for analyzing nested health data, offering several key advantages over traditional approaches:

#### 9.1. Key Takeaways

1. **Hierarchical Structure Recognition**: Health outcomes are naturally nested within geographic, administrative, and organizational units that create dependencies in the data.

2. **Variance Partitioning**: Multilevel models partition total variation into meaningful components, helping identify whether interventions should target individuals, communities, or policy levels.

3. **Cross-Level Interactions**: These models can test whether higher-level factors (policies, resources) modify the effectiveness of lower-level interventions.

4. **Centering Decisions Matter**: The choice between grand-mean centering, group-mean centering, or contextual models fundamentally changes what questions your analysis answers.

5. **Policy Evaluation**: The framework supports sophisticated policy evaluation by modeling direct effects, indirect effects, and contextual modifications.

```

#### 9.3. When to Use Multilevel Models in Research

Multilevel modeling is particularly valuable when:

- Data has clear hierarchical structure (counties in states, patients in hospitals)
- Research questions involve both individual and contextual effects
- Interest lies in understanding variation at multiple levels
- Cross-level interactions are theoretically important
- Standard errors need to account for clustering
- Policy evaluation requires understanding of contextual factors

#### 9.4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Ignoring clustering**: Using standard regression when data is nested leads to incorrect standard errors
2. **Over-parameterization**: Adding random slopes for every predictor without theoretical justification
3. **Misinterpreting centering**: Not being clear about what centering approach was used and what it means
4. **Small sample sizes at Level 2**: Having too few groups (< 20-30) for reliable variance estimates
5. **Ignoring diagnostics**: Not checking model assumptions can lead to invalid conclusions

The combination of multilevel modeling with proper centering strategies, diagnostic checking, and thoughtful interpretation provides health researchers and policymakers with the statistical tools necessary to understand complex, nested relationships in health data and to design more effective, targeted interventions that account for the multilevel nature of health determinants.
